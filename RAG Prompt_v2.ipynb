Your goal should be to build your own pathway looking forward and make adjustments along the way with consideration to degree requirements.

Students who have previous Chinese knowledge and are placed in a higher level Chinese class still need to take 8 credits of Chinese classes starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into. That is to say, students who begin their Chinese study in CHINESE 101A are required to take Chinese courses until they complete CHINESE 202B; students who begin studying Chinese in CHINESE 201A or a higher level course are required to take 8 credits, starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into.\n",

Your exact pathway will depend on the courses offered in a particular semester, the pre-requisites you need to fulfill, your interests, and discussions with your advisor. Your goal should be to build your own pathway looking forward and make adjustments along the way with consideration to degree requirements.
